<p>
Human resources (HR) management has long been a critical aspect of organizational management, as it involves managing the most valuable asset of any organization: its employees. However, as companies and their workforces continue to grow, retaining qualified employees and maintaining a healthy work environment has become increasingly challenging. To address these challenges, businesses have revolutionized their way of approaching HR management through the usage of HR systems. <br>
